# Quick Start Guide - Cancelled Orders System

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE FIX - System is now working in Basic Mode**

The system has been fixed and is now working in **Basic Mode**. You can cancel orders and track them immediately without running any database changes.

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

1. **Order Cancellation**: You can cancel orders from the complete orders page
2. **Stock Restoration**: Stock is automatically restored when orders are cancelled
3. **Basic Tracking**: Cancelled orders are tracked and displayed
4. **Statistics**: Basic counts and statistics are shown
5. **Navigation**: Cancelled orders link works with count badge

## 🔧 **How to Use (Right Now)**

### 1. **Cancel an Order**
- Go to "All Complete Orders"
- Click the dropdown menu for any order
- Select "Cancel Order"
- Fill in the reason (optional)

3. **No code changes needed** - it will detect the new table

## 🔍 **How Basic Mode Works**
