# ðŸ§ª Test Cancellation Counting & Tracking

## **Testing the Fixed System**

The system should now be properly counting and tracking cancelled orders. Here's how to test it:

## âœ… **What Should Work Now**

1. **Order Cancellation**: Orders can be cancelled with stock restoration
2. **Counting**: System counts total, monthly, daily, and recent cancellations
3. **Tracking**: Shows cancelled orders with proper dates and status
4. **Navigation Badge**: Shows count of cancelled orders in menu
5. **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time counts in the cancelled orders page

## ðŸ”§ **How to Test**

### 1. **Test Order Cancellation**
1. Go to "All Complete Orders"
2. Find an order to cancel
3. Click dropdown â†’ "Cancel Order"
4. Fill in reason (optional)
5. Confirm cancellation
6. **Verify**: Order should disappear from complete orders

### 2. **Test Counting**
1. Go to "Cancelled Orders" page
2. **Check Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Total Cancelled Orders: Should show > 0
   - Cancelled This Month: Should show current month count
   - Cancelled Today: Should show today's count
   - Last 7 Days: Should show recent count

### 3. **Test Navigation Badge**
1. Look at the "Cancelled Orders" menu item
2. **Should show**: Red badge with count number
3. **Count should match**: Total from statistics dashboard

### 4. **Test Tracking**
1. In "Cancelled Orders" page
2. **Table should show**:
   - Order numbers
   - Original status (Confirm)
   - Cancelled date
   - Stock restored status
   - Action buttons

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results**

### **Before Cancelling Orders**
- Total Cancelled: 0
- Navigation badge: None
- Table: "No cancelled orders found"

### **After Cancelling 1 Order**
- Total Cancelled: 1
- Navigation badge: Red badge with "1"
- Table: Shows 1 cancelled order
- Statistics: All counts should update

## ðŸ†˜ **If Still Not Working**

### **Check These Issues**

1. **Database Connection**
   - Verify database is accessible
   - Check for connection errors

2. **Order Status Logic**
   - Orders must be 'confirm' status to be cancelled
   - Cancelled orders become 'draft' status

3. **Date Comparison**
   - System compares `modified_date` vs `created_date`
   - Only counts orders modified after creation

4. **Group By Issues**
   - System groups by `order_number` to avoid duplicates
   - Each order number counted only once

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Server Logs** for PHP errors
3. **Verify Database Tables** exist and are accessible
4. **Test Simple Database Query** to ensure connection works

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

âœ… **Order cancellation works**
âœ… **Stock is restored**
âœ… **Counts are accurate**
âœ… **Navigation badge shows**
âœ… **Statistics dashboard works**
âœ… **Table displays cancelled orders**
